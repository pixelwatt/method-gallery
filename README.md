# method-gallery

## v2.0.0-beta1

This is the initial beta for a rewrite of the Method Gallery plugin. This release adds a post type and custom taxonomy for building filterable galleries in a variety of different formats, with lightbox support. It is not recommended that you upgrade to this release if you are using the legacy Method_Gallery class, as conflicting versions of swiper will be loaded. The option to only enqueue the old version will be included in a later release.
